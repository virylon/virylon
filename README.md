## Hi there 👋 I'm Ruilong Wei.

💬 I am a PhD student at Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  

🌱 I received MA.Eng. degree of Earth exploration and information technology from Chengdu University of Technology in 2022.

🔭 My research interest is Remote Sensing and Deep Learning.  

Here is my [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruilong-Wei) & [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=s3dBvNIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
